# ASLEEP

Hack OHI/O 2018 Project by David Grougan and Marie Pendley. Contendor for Microsoft's Best AI hack with Azure Cognitive Services. ASLEEP is a game which actively monitors the player's emotional stat as well as facial characteristics, and modifies gameplay depending on the details which it observes. 

## Project Details

Built in Unity 2018 using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Face API. The core functionality is built around capturing images from the system's webcam, getting them processed by Azure, and parsing the data into a format which is conducive to game design.

Utilizing artificial intelligence powered by a service like Azure Cognitive Services could open up a window of possibilities for game design, experiences can be reactive based on how players respond to certain situations, creating an overall richer experience.
